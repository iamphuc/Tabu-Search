# Tabu Search on Product Line Design

In this project, I tried to solve Product Line Design (PLD) problem using Tabu Search (TS). TS is a heuristic that has been applied to solve problems in various fields. However, in the context PLD, to the best of my knowledge, as of December 2021, there is only one paper that implements TS to solve an instance of the general PLD problem. The author shows that TS performs better than Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing even when parameters of the original problem are varied.
