## Development
This work was part of the seminar thesis I wrote in the Fall semester 2021 at the Chair of Revenue Management [Prof. Dr. Cornelia Schön](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/schoen/ "Prof. Dr. Cornelia Schön"), University of Mannheim on product line design optimization. 

## Background

In this project, I tried to solve Product Line Design (PLD) problem using Tabu Search (TS). TS is a heuristic that has been applied to solve problems in various fields. However, in the context PLD, to the best of my knowledge, as of December 2021, there is only one paper that implements TS to solve an instance of the general PLD problem. The author shows that TS performs better than Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing even when parameters of the original problem are varied.

TS is able to identify the global optimum in this 2D multimodal function thanks to its *Tabu Move*
